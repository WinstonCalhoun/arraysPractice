How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
Every time I do these over again, I understand it more and more.


Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
No, this is very easy to grasp once it clicks in the brain of how to use it in english sentences and then working backwards to confirm thats how the array reads.

What questions do you have about Arrays?
All questions that I have had, have already come up.  The reading is very good at explaining things so that if there is confusion, it can be looked back upon.  My fellow students have been very helpful when stuck and not having a question but forgetting a step to make sure it makes sense.
